## Overview
The AWS AI Landing Zone is a well-architected, scalable framework for organizing and managing AI/ML workloads on AWS. It provides a structured approach to set up AWS accounts, security controls, networking, and AI/ML services across development, testing, and production environments.

## Purpose
This landing zone helps organizations:
- Establish a secure foundation for AI/ML workloads
- Implement proper isolation between environments
- Apply consistent security and governance controls
- Optimize costs through FinOps practices
- Enable observability and monitoring
- Streamline the MLOps lifecycle

## Architecture
The landing zone consists of several organizational units (OUs):

### Management OU
Central account for managing the entire landing zone with services like:
- AWS Config
- IAM Identity Center
- AWS KMS
- AWS Organizations

### Security OU
Dedicated to security monitoring and enforcement:
- GuardDuty
- Security Hub
- Macie
- Network monitoring

### Observability OU
Centralized monitoring and observability:
- CloudWatch
- X-Ray
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch

### FinOps OU
Cost management and optimization:
- Budgets
- Tagging strategies
- Cost Explorer
- Optimization tools

### AI Environment OUs
Separate OUs for different stages of the AI/ML lifecycle:

#### AI DEV OU
Development environment with:
- MLOps & Automation Account
- Network Account
- Data processing pipeline:
  - Dirty Datasets Account
  - Data Transformation Account
  - Processed Datasets Account
- LLMs and Foundation Models Account
- Application Account
- Frontend Account

#### AI TEST OU
Similar structure to DEV but isolated for testing purposes

#### AI PROD OU
Production environment with the highest security and reliability standards

## Complementary Services
The landing zone integrates with AWS AI services:
- AWS Lake Formation
- AWS Glue
- AWS Step Function
- AWS Secrets Manager
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS SageMaker
- AWS Bedrock

## Getting Started
1. Begin with the Management Account setup
2. Deploy the Security OU and establish baseline security controls
3. Configure the Observability OU for monitoring
4. Set up the FinOps OU for cost management
5. Deploy the AI environment OUs based on your development lifecycle needs

## Best Practices
- Maintain strict separation between DEV, TEST, and PROD environments
- Apply least privilege access controls
- Implement consistent tagging for resources
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines for MLOps
- Establish data governance policies
- Monitor costs and performance regularly
